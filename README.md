# whatAreYouDoing?
An applescript that asks you what you are doing at a user defined interval, using mac native dialogs, and records it into a text file on your desktop with time stamps

IF you are set up to use Orbot, please not you cant use WAYD to input information into your timesheet in 15 minute intervals. 
Simply format your input as: ```<task id> <action notes>``` and WAYD i will do the rest, using Orbot (special thanks to Joe Haines!)

Please edit away as usefull by opening Script Editor on your mac, and opening the .app file with it. 

Feel free to PR away with reckless abandon
